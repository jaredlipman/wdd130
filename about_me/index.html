    <h2>Jared Lipman</h2>
    <h2>Jed</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Jared and I'm majoring in Web Design. This class is the beginning of a long future for me. I come from Martinez CA, right near San Francisco. I'm only 18 years old, so I have a lot of time left ahead of me to get married and have children. In the meantime, I fill my time with various hobbies. Mainly I collect toys and play video games, but I also like to dance and DJ. Here at BYU-I I am persuing a BS, so I'm going to be here for a while. My favorite thing about this school is the DND club.
        </p>
       <p> Web design is a growing field, and almost everything is online these days. This is why I believe going into web design is the best choice for me.
        I have been a member of The Church since I was eight years old, my parents raised me in The Gospel. Over the years, I have gained a personal testimony and conversion.
