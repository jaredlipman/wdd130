        Why should you pony?
        
        To clarify what I mean by "ponying", I mean enjoying the show My Little Pony. Ever since the year 1986 when ponies first started arriving in television sets, people have been enjoying their adorable antics. Whether you were a child or an adult, it was impossible to turn a blind eye to their charm. Over the years, we have gotten more and more pony content, and a fanbase to grow with it.
        
        Why should you care about these adorable pastel horses? 
        
        You may turn down the opprotunity to delve into this beloved content due to the fact that the show was originaly designed for children. What the adults behind the show have admitted is that they had an older audience in mind while making the characters and episodes as well. So much thought was put into the background stories of each character and area of the show, and anyone with an open mind can see how great it is; no matter their age.

        So a ton of adults and teenagers love My Little Pony?

        Yes! Many of us taking the name "Brony" or "Bronies" as a group, we have been bonding as a community ever since 2012, when "Friendship is Magic" became extremely popular on the internet. "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" is the show that most fans have come to enjoy, being the reboot for the series released in 2010. The show has brought us all together and truly showed us that friendship IS magic.

      <h3>Meet the Mane Six</h3>
      <p>
        These are the main characters that fans see most in the show. These friends should give you a good idea of what kind of people like the show, and what kind of characters you can hope to meet while watching.

        Twilight Sparkle - A studious and intellectual type, this unicorn thought that having friends was unecessary until a live changing experience that taught her the true magic behind friendship.

        Pinkie Pie - This energetic and fun loving earth pony (a pony that is neither a unicorn nor pegasus) knows how to make anyone smile. She is always planning parties for people and makes sure that everypony has a friend.

        Applejack - An earth pony that tends to the soil and loves putting in a hard day's work. Honesty is her policy, and she is always there to lend a hoof.

        Rainbow Dash - This pegasus loves to move fast! Her dream is to join a flying troupe called "The Wonderbolts", and she works very hard towards that goal. Because of her loyal nature however, she always puts friends before dreams.

        Rarity - A fashion designer and buisness owner, this unicorn loves making designs for her friends and always has an eye for beauty. With so much talent to give, it's no surprise that she is also very generous.

        Fluttershy - Her personality is as soft as she looks. When it comes to caring for animals, this pegasus is your go-to pony. Although she is softspoken, that will never stop her from being kind. She is often seen with her pet bunny, Angel.
