        Why should you pony?
        
        To clarify what I mean by "ponying", I mean enjoying the show My Little Pony. Ever since the year 1986 when ponies first started arriving in television sets, people have been enjoying their adorable antics. Whether you were a child or an adult, it was impossible to turn a blind eye to their charm. Over the years, we have gotten more and more pony content, and a fanbase to grow with it.
        
        Why should you care about these adorable pastel horses? 
        
        You may turn down the opprotunity to delve into this beloved content due to the fact that the show was originaly designed for children. What the adults behind the show have admitted is that they had an older audience in mind while making the characters and episodes as well. So much thought was put into the background stories of each character and area of the show, and anyone with an open mind can see how great it is; no matter their age.

        So a ton of adults and teenagers love My Little Pony?

        Yes! Many of us taking the name "Brony" or "Bronies" as a group, we have been bonding as a community ever since 2012, when "Friendship is Magic" became extremely popular on the internet. "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" is the show that most fans have come to enjoy, being the reboot for the series released in 2010. The show has brought us all together and truly showed us that friendship IS magic.
